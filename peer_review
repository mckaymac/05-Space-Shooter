Peer's repository: 



What is something you learned by reviewing your peer's project?
    I learned that it is fairly easy to change the size of the sprites used in the code, which the user did to make the ship appear larger. 
 

What is something you saw in your peer's project that you would like to apply to your own programming projects?
    The coder used very precise collision checks, which cuts down on extra code. 
 

What suggestions would you have for your peer to improve his/her code?
    The code works perfectly as is, but the game itself could be more interesting if the coder made the enemies move, added a background, or etc. 
 

What could have been clearer or better commented?
    The coder could have made a comment indicating which command causes the sprite to disappear once it has been "killed"
 

Was there anything in the code that was confusing to you? If so, what?
    The code was very clear and concise. I was not confused by anything. 
 

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?
    Yes!
 

What is something he/she could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?
    The read me is nice and creative. It could contain more detail about the use of arcade and arcade commands in the actual code. 
 

Pay a compliment to your peer based on the quality of his/her code.
    The code is very concise and well put together. I also enjoyed the read me, which I thought was very
    creative and fun to read.
